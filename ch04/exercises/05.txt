Determined from the requirement that (a/b)*b + a%b must always be equal to a, for integers.
i.e, a%b = a - (a/b)*b

a) 3
b) -3 or 2

-8/5 = -1 or -2
(-8/5)*5 = -5 or -10
-8%5 = -3 or 2

c) 3 or -2

8/-5 = -1 or -2
(8/-5)*-5 = 5 or 10
8%-5 = 3 or -2

d) -3 or 2

-8/-5 = 1 or 2
(-8/-5)*-5 = -5 or -10
-8%5 = -3 or 2
