a)
They indicate internal identifiers used by the compiler and standard library, which shouldn't
be used by a user program.
Also, they are there to prevent name clashes with user code, since identifiers beginning with
an underscore are reserved.

b)
The _ctype array contains a bitfield for each ASCII character, where the index is the int value of the character.
The position of the bits correspond to the macros _UPPER, _LOWER, _DIGIT, etc..

_ctype[9]  = 0b1010'1000
_ctype[32] = 0b1010'0000
_ctype[65] = 0b0100'0001

c)
Characters are represented as integer types so they can be used as an index for the array.
