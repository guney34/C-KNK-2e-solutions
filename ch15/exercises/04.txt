a)
Output if DEBUG is defined:
Value of i : 1
Value of j : 2
Value of k : 3
Value of i + j : 3
Value of 2 * i + j - k : 1

b)
Output if DEBUG is not defined:

DEBUG is not defined so the second printf statement is executed and
all of the uses of the PRINT_DEBUG macros are replaced by an empty character.

d)
Yes because the preprocessor executes directives line by line, so it won't know that
DEBUG is defined later in file.
