calls that don't work:

b) %c requires char but "\n" is a char*
c) %s requires char*  but '\n' is a char
e) the first argument of printf needs to be a string (char*)
h) putchar requires the argument to be a char not char*
i) argument needs to be a char*
j) puts automatically adds an extra new-line, so this call will create two new-lines
